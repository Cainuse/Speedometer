# Speedometer

## Limitations

* Mac OS or Linux only
* Does not support multi-file projects yet

## Usage
1. Clone the repo into your local computer
2. Create a python script of your choice:
    - Preferably make your script such that it can take in command line arguments as input to run the script with different input sizes n. 
    - Feel free to define some classes, functions and algorithms of your choosing.
    - We have some pre-defined test scripts to use [here](https://github.students.cs.ubc.ca/cpsc410-2020w-t1/cpsc410_project2_team4/tree/master/samples).
3. Create a config.json file that would go along with your previously created python script:
    - Your config.json file must follow [this](https://github.students.cs.ubc.ca/cpsc410-2020w-t1/cpsc410_project2_team4/blob/master/docs/Prototype-Design.md#the-config-file) format.

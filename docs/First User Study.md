In the time complexity analysis, I like the top down timeline view to see the call stack more clearly but the descriptions  (running foo) under each function seem to be trivial/not very useful. 

Line by line analysis seems great but it would be helpful if you could show what exact part of the code is causing the delay (a particular function call or data structure used?)

Performance summary is a great overview, color coding it is helpful. Maybe plot the actual functions on the graph to make it easier to visualize how performance scales as n (input size) increases? For instance if my function is n^2 but my input will only be between 1-10 in size It may not be that big of a deal compared to nlogn

For memory usage perhaps show which data structures use the most memory?

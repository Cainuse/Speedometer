Dash 1,
- Confused about start, what is start? The main function or the tester calling functions? (Clarify)
- Can you clarify what calls foo(), is it main or the tester? (Clarify)
- When bar() is called does that mean foo() has ended? Or is foo() still running but called bar()? (Clarify)
- Graph, what is x and y? I am assuming x is the size of n and y is time in sec. Then what is the point of showing all the Big-O if we do not include the current analysis. Also, rather than showing an array of Big-O you can show Big-Theta. Thus, giving us 1 lower bound and 1 upper bound. (Or update your legend to reflect what you want.)
- What is Runtime per module? (Not sure what it is for)
- What is the pie chart talking about? (Space? Time?)

Dash 2,
-I see percentages, but what are they representing? Space? Time?
-Make the sections consistent. (One sections be function)


Dash 3,
-Long(n) Are you sure you meant ln(n)
-Same thing about the graphs.

function-execution-times-table,
-add units to clarify. (Is runtime in sec? ms?)

n-load bar chart,
-Clarify if this is for the script, or individual functions. If it is a function which one?

Overall, the design looks good. If this was a real application, I would use it. Dash 1 and Dash 2 are both useful pages that I would use. Specifically, in Dash 1, the timeline is the most helpful in my eyes. On the other hand, I struggle to understand the use of the run-time-per-module and the line graph. Dash 2 has good design, but I would like more ways to minimize each section to see only 70% while the rest are "hidden". Otherwise good idea there so far.
